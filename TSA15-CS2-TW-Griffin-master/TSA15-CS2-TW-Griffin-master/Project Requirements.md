**Team work assignment** for Telerik Academy students participating in **C# Part 2** course.

### Project Description
Design and implement a Console Game by choice. It could be a classic well-known application like Minesweeper, Tetris, Chess, Snake, etc., but you can design your own type of game. You are absolutely free to choose the topic of your work.

### General Requirements
Please define and implement the following assets in your project:
* At least __1 multi-dimensional array__
* At least __3 one-dimensional arrays__
* At least __10 methods__ (separating the application’s logic)
* At least __3 existing .NET classes__ (like System.Math or System.DateTime)
* At least __2 exception handlings__
* At least __1 use of external text file__

### Additional Requirements
* Obligatory use **Git** to keep your source code and for team collaboration (you might use http://github.com or http://code.google.com). SVN or TFS are not allowed. **Use Git. To understand better what Source Control Systems are, you can watch this lecture**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFvayHoUIPg
* Provide documentation for **your application** (more information below).

### Optional Requirements
If you have a chance, time and a suitable situation, you might add some of the following to your project:
* **Object Oriented Programming** (classes, interfaces, structures, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.)
* **Serialization of the data in the text file** (binary)
* **Sound effects during the gameplay**

### Non-Required Work
* **Completely finished project** is not obligatory required. It will not be a big problem if your project is not completely finished or is not working greatly. This team work project is for educational purpose. Its main purpose is to experience working on a real-world project and to get some experience in team collaboration with Git.

### Deliverables
Put the following in a ZIP archive and submit it (each team member submits the same file):
* The complete __source code.__
* Brief __documentation__ of your project (2-3 pages). It should provide the following information (in brief):
  * Team name and list of team members (including __usernames__ from the student system)
  * Project explanation – describe your game
  * The URL of your Git repository
  * Any other information (optionally)
* Optionally provide a __PowerPoint presentation__ designed for the project defense.

### Public Project Defense
Each team will have to deliver a public defense of its work in from of the other students and trainers. You will have only 5 minutes for the following:
* __Demonstrate__ the game (very shortly).
* Show the __source code__ in the Git web-based source code browser.
* Show the __commits logs__ to confirm that each team member has contributed.
* Optionally you might prepare a PowerPoint presentation (3-4 slides).
Please be strict in timing! Be **well prepared** for presenting maximum of your work for minimum time. Bring your own laptop. Test it preliminary with the multimedia projector. Open the project assets beforehand to save time. **You have 5 minutes**, no more. It is not necessary for all team members to participate in the project defense.

### Give Feedback about Your Teammates
You will be invited to **provide feedback** about all your teammates, their attitude to this project, their technical skills, their team working skills, their contribution to the project, etc. The feedback is important part of the project evaluation so **take it seriously** and **be honest**.
